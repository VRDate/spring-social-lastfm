This project is a work in progress with a few methods of the LastFm Api implemented so far. These include:

Retrieving a LastFm user's basic profile info
Retrieving a LastFm user's Loved, Recent, or Top Tracks
Performing a basic track search
Updating a LastFm users' now listening status
Simple scrobbling

Method signatures are initial at this stage and support basic operations only (not implementing pagination for example) - these will be updated
in the near future.

Please note that as LastFm's auth scheme is *neither* OAuth1 or OAuth2, this Spring Social module is incompatible with 
Spring's current ProviderSignInController - instead please use the custom LastFmSignInController or LastFmConnectController provided with 
this module which adds support for LastFm auth.    

This module has a dependency on SocialSignIn's spring-social-web-non-oauth-extension as a temporary measure until such time
as Spring's own ProviderSignInController/ConnectController are cabable of supporting non-OAuth providers (ie. can be
extended for custom auth).  The spring-social-web-non-oauth-extension project is available at

https://github.com/socialsignin/spring-social-web-non-oauth-extension

Please build the spring-social-web-non-oauth-extension and install into your local repo in order to use spring-social-lastfm,
until I get the chance to deploy this project into a public mvn repo
