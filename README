Please note that as LastFm's auth scheme is neither OAuth1 or OAuth2, this Spring Social module is incompatible with 
Spring's current ProviderSignInController - instead please use the custom LastFmProviderSignInController provided with 
this module which adds support for LastFm auth

Also, please note that at the moment this module does not send identifiable UserAgent headers with requests - a requirement
of the use of LastFm's api.  Please do not use this module without first resolving this issue
